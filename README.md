# Face-Recognition-Web-Authentication

## Introduction
With the progress in mobile processors, we have seen that Face ID has become a very good solution for authentication. It is mostly used with dedicated processors which are specifically designed to perform such tasks but, is it possible to authenticate users with Face ID over the web on a browser?
Web servers have a limited amount of computing power and other resources so, it becomes a very tough tasks for them to process face ID authentication with high accuracy.
In this Project I would like to demonstrate a mechanism which can process face ID authentication over the web.
